questions: 

1. If you are building a processor and have to do static branch prediction (meaning you have to assume at compile time whether a branch is taken or not), how should you do it? You can make a different decision for branches that go forward or backward.
2. If you are building a 256-byte direct-mapped cache, what should you choose as your block (line) size?
3. What conclusions can you draw about the differences between compiling with no optimization and -O2 optimization?
